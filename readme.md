# Basics of the Unix Philosophy

I rediscovered the timeless *Basics of the Unix Philosophy* buried in my files awhile ago, and immediately thought how good it would be to adapt them for use as a human rather than a machine. So I made a repo for it, because I’d absorbed the document internally and realised that I follow some of the principles in actual life without even thinking about it. So in the Unix spirit of sharing, here’s my attempt to translate these principles to human life.

See the result: [“Unix for Life”](https://daveeveritt.github.io/unix-for-life/).

See Eric Raymond’s version of the original [Basics of the Unix Philosophy](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html). My [condensed version is here](unix-basics.md).
